2 Course Description
This is an advanced course on linguistic meaning. We begin by considering semantics from the foundational perspective of philosophy of language. We then start building students’ understanding of some of the basic formal tools (logic,
lambda calculus). We next proceed to some speciﬁc advanced topics in semantics, such as quantiﬁers and noun phrase
interpretation, possible worlds and intensions, propositional attitudes, modality and conditionals. We ﬁnish with a
consideration of the relation of sentential semantics to formal pragmatics and discourse semantics.
Prerequisites: LALS 3505 or PHIL 3506 or permission of the Department of Philosophy or School of Linguistics
and Language Studies.

3 Readings
The reading(s) for each class are given in section 9 of this document and will also be announced in class. Revisions to
the reading list may also be announced in class. If you miss class, it is your responsibility to ﬁnd out what the readings
are.

3.1 Textbook
There are no texts to purchase for this class, just some required readings (see next section).

3.2 Required Readings
There are a number of required readings for the course.
Each reading is available electronically at the URL provided (see section 8).
Note: Links annotated with an asterisk (*) are subscription resources that must be accessed on campus at Carleton,
or through the library’s web site or after having logged in to the Carleton VPN. Carleton’s VPN software is available at
http://apps.carleton.ca/ntw/vpn/. If you are not a Carleton student, you should be able to access these
sites through your own institution’s library subscriptions. If you have difﬁculties, please contact me.
Any readings whose link is not annotated with an asterisk is available for download here:
http://134.117.124.204:8000/Carleton/LALS4507-2009/Readings/
You will be provided with a user name and password in class. Please do not share this information with people outside
the class.

4 Assessment
There are four components to how you will be assessed in this course: in-class participation (including attendance),
assignments, a squib, and a ﬁnal exam.

4.1 Assignments
You are allowed to collaborate on assignments, but each student must submit their own write-up. I would appreciate
it if assignments were typed, but feel free to draw structures or make annotations by hand.
Assignment 1 Distributed January 26, 2009, due February 9, 2009.
Assignment 2 Distributed February 11, 2009, due March 9, 2009.
Assignment 2 Distributed March 16, 2009, due April 1, 2009.
Assignments are non-cumulative. This means that they will not test material that was covered in a previous assignment
(but that material could be relevant to understanding of new material). Each assignment may cover up to the last
Wednesday class before the assignment is due.

4.2 Squib
You will have to write a squib as your term paper in this class. It should be 5–10 pages long, assuming double spacing
and reasonable font size and margins.
A squib is a very short paper that identiﬁes a set of data that is somehow puzzling or theoretically problematic. A
squib does not necessarily posit a solution to the problem, but the very best squibs will at the very least try to form
some kind of coherent generalization about the data, although typically stopping short of providing a theoretically
well-founded or formalized solution (these would be appropriate for a full-ﬂedged article). For examples of linguistics
squibs, see the journal Linguistic Inquiry. The ‘golden age’ of LI squibs was arguably the 1970’s, but many excellent
squibs were published subsequently and the journal maintains its squibs section to this day. Another great source for
squibs is the online journal Snippets (http://www.ledonline.it/snippets/).
Chris Potts at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Linguistics Department has some excellent material on
his website about writing for linguistics in general and about squibs more particularly, including a sample squib:

3. Writing in Linguistics more generally: click here3 .
You are free to choose your topic. One option is to expand on some aspect of a homework assignment. Another
option is to explore a phenomenon/set of data from your native language (English counts!) or a set of data that you’ve
encountered in a grammar, etc. For the purposes of this class assignment, if the phenomenon/data you write about
turns out to have been well-studied, that’s okay. However, do not intentionally choose a well-studied topic. I advise
you to make an appointment to discuss your topic with me in a timely fashion.
A complete ﬁrst draft of your squib is due March 16, 2009. The ﬁnal draft is due on April 7, 2009 and should be
submitted in the SLaLS drop box outside 215 Paterson Hall.

5 Final Exam
The ﬁnal exam is cumulative and will be held during the scheduled exam period.

No submissions are accepted by fax or email.
Students are required to keep copies of their submissions.

6.3 Deferrals and Late Work
If, due to exceptional circumstances, you miss any of the submission deadlines, you must notify me as soon as possible.
Late submissions will automatically have 20% of their total mark deducted per 24 hours of lateness or part thereof.
No submission will be accepted after the ﬁfth day.
Late submissions must be submitted to the SLaLS ofﬁce (215 Paterson Hall) or in the drop box immediately outside the ofﬁce. Submissions will be date-stamped (during normal opening hours on weekdays only, not on weekends
or university holidays). Clearly indicate course code, your name and my name on the submission.

6.4 Statement Regarding Plagiarism
From Carleton University’s Undergraduate and Graduate Calendars:
Plagiarism is presenting, whether intentional or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others as
one’s own. Plagiarism includes reproducing or paraphrasing portions of someone else’s published or
unpublished material, regardless of the source, and presenting these as one’s own without proper citation
or reference to the original source. Examples of sources from which the ideas, expressions of ideas
or works of others may be drawn from include but are not limited to: books, articles, papers, literary
compositions and phrases, performance compositions, chemical compounds, art works, laboratory reports,

In cases where an investigation determines that a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy has occurred,
sanctions may be applied by the Faculty Dean, the Provost and Vice President (Academic), or by Senate
Executive.
Sanctions may include but are not limited to completion of a remediation process, a written reprimand,
assignment of a failing grade, withdrawal from a course, suspension from a program, suspension or expulsion from the University. Sanctions may be used independently or in combination for any single
violation. This list is not exhaustive and intended only as a guide. For a complete description of possible
sanctions, consult Section IX, Sanctions, of the Carleton University Academic Integrity Policy, available
